# Local GitHub CLI token (for running make deploy-gh* targets)
# Do NOT commit real tokens. This file is an example.
# Actual token file is .github/gh.env (ignored by .gitignore).

# Personal access token with scopes: repo, workflow
# Example:
# GH_TOKEN=ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Usage:
# - Place a real token in .github/gh.env as a single line:
#     GH_TOKEN=ghp_...
# - Then run from the deployment folder:
#     make deploy-gh
#     make deploy-gh-status
#     make deploy-gh-logs
#     make deploy-gh-watch
